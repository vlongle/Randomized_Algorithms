    "In deterministic algorithms, for a fixed input $x$, the output is $f(x)$, only depending on the inputs. In randomized algorithms, the output is $f(x, c)$, depending on both the input and the random bit $c$. Thus, we can get two different answers on the same input for randomized algorithm while we always get the same answer in deterministic. \n",

From a practical perspective, if we say the algorithm succeeds with prob $p$ for any given input, then we expect $np$ successes with $n$ problems to solve. $np$ is mean of binomial distribution. And the fraction of successes converges to the mean under the Law of Large Numbers for $n$ large enough.\n",
