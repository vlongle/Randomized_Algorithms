    "## Problem\n",
    "We introduce the problem of stable matching. Let say we have $n$ colleges and $m$ students applying. Each college has a list of preference/ ranking of students and each student also has a preference list for colleges. For simplicity, let say $m=n$. The problem is to match each college with one student such that the resulting configuration is __stable__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stability is defined as no switching would be possible. In a unstable matching, Alice is matched to UMass and Bob is matched to Cornell (picture!). However, Alice prefers Cornell and Cornell prefers Alice. This creates unstability since switching is possible. In marriage arrangement version of stable matching, a man covets thy neighbor's wife and the wife also likes the man better than her husband. This creates opportunity for cheating!  (yeah, it's very dark)"

    "Note that a scenario where Alice prefers Cornell and Bob prefers UMass is not necessarily unstable since there's nothing Alice and Bob can do. Maybe, UMass likes Alice a lot and Cornell likes Bob a lot so the students' preference don't really matter. This is the scenario where two men covet each other's wives but there're nothing they can do if the wives are not onboard. "

For example, if every student prefers UMass but UMass only has the capacity to admit 1 student, of course there's no matching that will make everyone totally happy. We opt for a stable matching since\n",
    "* It's mathematically well-defined and thus probably doable.\n",

    "Before presenting the alg, note that it's not very clear that given two preference lists, there exists a stable matching in the first place. The remarkable thing about Gale-Shapley is that by explicitly finding a stable matching solution, it indirectly proves the existence of a stable matching. In our scheme, the alg. would strictly favor colleges over students (more on this later). \n",

    "We argue that the alg. must terminate. Note that once a college has a student, it will always have a student (it only exchange bad student for better student but never lose student). So since there're $n$ students and $n$ colleges, the alg. terminates whenever all colleges are matched. A college must lie somewhere in the preference list of each student. So if there's unmatched student, eventually each college must be applied to. So, the alg. terminates. Moreover, the alg. terminates in $O(n^2)$ round. Note that each student can only apply to college that he hasn't been rejected from. There're $n$ students and $n$ colleges so there are $n^2$ possible applications! (an application is a student-college pair)  No application is repeated so it must terminates in $O(n^2)$. "

Say Alice likes Cornell better than UMass and Cornell likes Alice better than Bob. Now, the optimality for colleges comes into play. Note that colleges are never worse off each round. The only reason, a college replaces its admitted student is that the colleges finds a better student (in its eyes) to the current student. Now, if Alice prefers Cornell, then in the alg. Alice must apply to Cornell before UMass. But Cornell doesn't have Alice in their class at the end. This means that whoever is in Cornell's class, he must be better than Alice (in Cornell's opinion). So Cornell must prefer Bob to Alice. There's no instability! Contradiction!"

In every turn of the alg, an unmatched student randomly apply to one of the colleges and we're waiting for the moment where all $n$ colleges have been applied to. So we're collecting colleges as soccer cards essentially. The runtime for coupon collection is $nH_n$ so that's the upper-bound for Gale-Shapley alg."
